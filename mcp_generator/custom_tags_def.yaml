orgs_nac: "NAC related objects for the organizations. It provides access to NAC Endpoints, NAC fingerprints, tags, and rules."
mxedges: "MX Edge related objects for the organizations. It provides access to Mist Edges, Mist Clusters, and Mist Tunnels."
webhooks: "A Webhook is a configuration that allows real-time events and data from the Org to be pushed to a provided url.\n\nIt enables the collection of information about various topics such as device events, alarms, and audits updates at the org level.\n\nThe Webhook can be set up and customized using the Mist API, allowing users to receive and analyze specific data from a particular site."
marvis: "Marvis is a virtual network assistant that provides insights and analytics for the Mist network. It can be used to analyze network performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize network configurations.\n\nIt includes features such as synthetic tests, which allow users to simulate network traffic and measure performance metrics."
devices: "Devices are any Network device managed or monitored by Juniper Mist. It can be * Wireless Access Points * Juniper Switch (EX, QFX) * Juniper WAN Gateway (SRX, SSR) * Mist Edges * Other or 3rd party devices, like Cradlepoint Devices. Mist provides many ways (device_type specific template, site template, device profile, per-device) to configure devices for different kind of scenarios.\n\nThe precedence goes from most specific to least specific\n\nDevice > Device Profile > RFTemplate (for AP only) > DeviceType-specific Template > Site Template > Site Setting"
configuration: "Configuration related objects for the sites and organizations. It provides access to various configuration objects such as site settings, device profiles, and more. These objects can be used to configure the network in a consistent manner."
sles: 'SLEs, or Service-Level Expectations, are metrics used to monitor and report on the user experience of a Wireless, Wired or Wan network.\n\nThey are generated through data science and machine learning algorithms and provide insights into various aspects of the network, such as coverage, capacity, connectivity, and performance.\n\nMist SLEs help identify when users do not have sufficient network quality, when they face issues with connecting or roaming between access points, and when there are problems on the wired network.\n\n SLEs API Calls at the MSP level can be used to retrieve the SLEs summary for each Organization attached to the MSP account.'
