# Mist MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI-powered access to Juniper Mist networking APIs. This project enables Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude to interact with Mist cloud-managed network infrastructure through a comprehensive set of tools.

## üìñ Overview

The Mist MCP Server consists of two main components:

1. **Code Generator** (`generate_mcp_tools.py`) - Automatically generates/updates MCP-compatible tools from the Mist OpenAPI specification
2. **MCP Server** (`src/`) - The actual MCP server that provides AI assistants with access to Mist APIs

This early-stage but functional project allows network engineers to interact with their Mist-managed infrastructure using natural language through AI assistants.

## üöÄ Features

- **Comprehensive API Coverage**: Auto-generated tools for all major Mist API endpoints
- **Dynamic Tool Management**: Enable/disable tool categories based on your needs
- **Intelligent Organization**: Tools are grouped by functionality (orgs, sites, devices, clients, etc.)
- **Type Safety**: Full type validation using Pydantic models
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and logging
- **AI-Optimized**: Designed specifically for LLM interaction patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Mist API credentials (API token and organization access)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 2. Generate MCP Tools (Optional)

The repository includes pre-generated tools, but you can regenerate them:

```bash
python generate_mcp_tools.py
```

This will:
- Parse the Mist OpenAPI specification (`mist.openapi.yaml`)
- Generate categorized tool modules in `src/mistmcp/tools/`
- Create tool configuration files

### 3. Configure MCP Server

The server can be run in two modes:

#### STDIO Mode (Recommended for Claude Desktop)
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "Mist MCP Server": {
            "command": "python",
            "args": [
                "-m",
                "mistmcp"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

#### HTTP Mode (For remote access)
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "Mist MCP Server": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "mcp-remote",
                "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

## üìã Usage

### With Claude Desktop

1. Add the server configuration to your Claude Desktop MCP settings
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Start a new conversation and ask about your Mist infrastructure:

```
"Show me the status of all my access points"
"What devices are having connectivity issues?"
"List all wireless clients on my guest network"
```

### With VS Code

1. Install the MCP extension for VS Code
2. Configure the server in your workspace settings
3. Use the MCP panel to interact with your Mist infrastructure
